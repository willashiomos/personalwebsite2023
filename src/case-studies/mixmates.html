        Mixmates is a platform on which music listeners can find and exchange
        with “playlist pen pals” of sorts, meaning users will send playlists
        (and messages) back and forth.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mixmates seeks to leverage the inherent social aspect of music and
        playlist curation, making it easier to find both connections with other
        listeners and music recommendations in the process.

  <h3>Design principles</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Connection</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Give first message prompts to get the conversation started</li>
        <li>After exchanging ten playlists with a Mixmate, users mail a physical CD copy of a playlist of their choice to their Mixmate</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Personality</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Ability to add notes to each song within playlists</li>
        <li>More details featured on profile pop over</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Safety</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Particular information required upon sign up to increase transparency</li>
        <li>Users can block or report other users at any time</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Process</h3>
  <p>Start with a <b>cultural probe</b> to investigate how people respond to principles of emotion and connection as they relate to music.</p>

  <p>
    Develop a <b>sitemap</b> and first round prototype, then user test.

  <p>
    Iterate prototype based on user testing.
